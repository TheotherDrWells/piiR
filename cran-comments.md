## CRAN submission comments for piiR

This is the initial submission of the `piiR` package to CRAN.

The `piiR` package provides tools for computing the Predictive Information Index (PII), which quantifies how much outcome-relevant information is retained when reducing a multivariate predictor set to a composite score (e.g., sum or mean). This is useful for evaluating the trade-offs of simplified scoring approaches in psychometrics, education, and applied research.

I have run R CMD check using:

- ‚úÖ **Ubuntu-latest** (via GitHub Actions)

All R CMD checks passed with:
- No errors ‚ùå
- No warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è
- No notes üìù

Except:
- A common note about unverified timestamps
- A harmless warning about the knitr vignette engine not being registered on macOS/Windows ‚Äî this does not affect vignette functionality
