# piiR

**piiR** provides a clean, standalone implementation of the Predictive Information Index (PII), a post-measurement metric designed to quantify how well a score predicts an outcome compared to a full model.

Version 0.3.0 includes only the canonical scoring functions and visualization tool. All non-canonical or experimental features have been removed.
